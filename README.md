# Fabric Defect Detection System

## Description
This project is a comprehensive fabric defect detection system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to accurately identify and classify various fabric defects, such as holes, stains, lines, and knots.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained to detect and classify fabric defects with over 90% accuracy.
- **Flask Backend**: Robust APIs for seamless defect detection and analysis.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Efficient image processing for defect identification.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides insights into fabric defects, facilitating informed decision-making in quality control.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Flask**
- **OpenCV**
